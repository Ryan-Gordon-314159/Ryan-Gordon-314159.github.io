    <div class="project">
      <h3>1) Large-Scale Data Processing with Python Pipelines for AI Model Training (Artificial Intelligence Program, IBM Research)</h3>
      <p>For this project, I developed, maintained, and continuously updated Python pipelines for doing large-scale data processing to train AI models at IBM Research. I was also responsible for running these pipelines to process datasets ~100 TB
         for preparing training data for creating AI models. Additionally, I was involved with doing triage for this processing, as it was extremely high priority and very resource intensive. For this work, I was awarded an IBM Research Award to recognize my contributions.</p>

        <h3>2) Building a Python SDK for Iterative Fine-Tuning of Models Utilizing a Generative AI System (Artificial Intelligence Program, IBM Research)</h3>
        <p>In this work, I created a Python software development kit (SDK) for fine tuning models on user-supplied datasets using IBM's internal Big AI Model (BAM) for doing retrieval augmented generation (RAG). In addition to fine tuning, this SDK was capable of anlyzing
          the log-prob values from the system's responses from the first fine tuning process. From this additional learning, I was
          able to show that the performance of the fine tuneed model is further improved after the learning from the log-prob data is used to further train the model on the supplied dataset.

        <h3>3) Development Work on /data-prep-kit, an IBM Research Product for Enabling AI Researchers in Data Preparation for LLM Applications (Artificial Intelligence Program, IBM Research)</h3>
        <p>In this project, I wrote a data processing transform, helped to test the recommended procedure for setting up the repository to do development as a test user, and I helped compile documentation for various parts of this work. The transform that I wrote was for doing language identification
        and it is called the lang_id transform. It will identify the language for a given text with a confidence score using the fasttext language identification model.

        <h3> 1) Developing Software for Investigating Two-Qubit Gate Fidelity vs Repetition Rate in IBM's State-of-the-Art Multi-Qubit Quantum Processors (Quantum Computing Program, IBM Research)</h3>
        <p>I was the Project Manager for this project at IBM Research, where I led a team of 5 people on developing the software necessary for collecting data on large, Multi-Qubit
          processors to directly measure how the two-qubit gate fidelities are limited in performance as quantum circuits are run faster and faster on them. As a result, our team was able to build
          high quality visualizations to see exactly how these curves of gate fidelity vs repition rate look for a large number of pairs of interacting qubits, across multiple processors. This data was
          used by the IBM Research senior management for assessing milestones related to state-of-the-art quantum processors and to develop future goals for the quantum volume metric in the Quantum Computing Program at IBM Research.

        <h3> 2) Studying Environmental Impact on Qubit Performance Using Python Automation for High-Throughput Measurements (Quantum Computing Program, IBM Research)</h3>
        <p>As the Project Manager for this work, I led a team of 10 people to investigate how the lifetimes of quantum bits, qubits, are impacted by various factors in their operating environment, utilizing Python automation that I contributed to developing. During this project, we studied how qubits can be sensitive
          to electromagnetic radiation by varying the amount of shielding that is used around them during the measurement of such quantities as relaxation time, coherence time, and dephasing time. Our team also looked at the impact on the qubits from controlled variations in temperature, exposure to radioactivity
          , magnetism, and vibrations. This project taught us much about engineering the environment for the qubits to maximize their performance for quantum computation and the results are summarized in the peer-reviewed publication linked just below. Additionally, a new qubit package was engineered with the
          learning from this project and incorporated into the design, which produced the highest relaxation time ever reported for a superconducting transmon qubit. See the link below to the Twitter announcemnt for reaching this milestone.

        <h3>3) Automation of Qubit Characterization and Calibration Procedures for Single-Qubit Testing at IBM Research (Quantum Computing Program, IBM Research)</h3>
        <p>As my first project at IBM Research, I worked on a cross-functional team whose goal was to improve qubit relaxation times, otherwise known as T1, for quantum computing applications. As a software engineer, my goal was to automate the process of measuring qubit T1 for a standard IBM package allowing for a high throughput
           for device measurement. This automation process involved communicating with a variety of instruments, ranging from those that control the qubit's temperature inside of the dilution refrigerator environment in which they are measured, to instrument that send microwave pulses to the qubits to characterize their T1 values.
           This work resulted in Python automation that was able to measure the T1 values for an entire IBM package consisting of hundreds of qubits, as soon as the device has cooled below 20 mK, all without any user intervention. This automation capability allowed for quick turnaround in measuring IBM qubit packaging and a rapid
           increase in the T1 values of our teams qubits.
